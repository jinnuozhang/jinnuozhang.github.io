Welcome to my personal website! I am now working as a postdoctoral research associate in the [ABE Plant Sensor Lab](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABEPlantSensorLab) at Purdue University. My project started in August 2023. We are currently doing some research on detecting the nutrient deficiency of corn plants using the self-developed handheld hyperspectral imaging device, called [LeafSpec](https://www.leafspecllc.com/). If you are interested in our reasearch, please free feel to reach out.
