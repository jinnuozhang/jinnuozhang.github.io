Because bacterial blight (BB) disease seriously affects the yield and quality of rice, breeding BB resistant rice is an important priority for plant breeders but the process is time-consuming. The feasibility of using terahertz imaging technology and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology to identify BB resistant seeds has therefore been studied. The two-dimensional (2D) spectral images and one-dimensional (1D) spectra provided by both imaging methods were used to build discriminant models based on a deep learning method, the convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The highest classification accuracy was achieved by the discriminate model based on CNN using the terahertz absorption spectra. Confusion matrixes were pictured to show the identification details. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method was used to visualize the process of CNN data processing. Terahertz imaging technology combined with CNN has great potential to quickly identify BB resistant rice seeds and is more accurate than using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging.
